        <h2 style="text-align:center">Kids Ministry</h2>

        At Bayfront Village Church, we provide a safe kid’s ministry environment for infants thru 5th grade. We would love to see you visit and want you to know what to expect for your children on your first visit.

        In order to serve our Bayfront Village Kids, our volunteers pass an application process that includes a background check. We want to lead our kids through a discipleship process that teaches them how the Bible is a unified story about God’s redemption. We take them through scripture with a gospel-centered focus, expecting hearts to be transformed.

        <h3> What To Expect </h3>

        <h4> Before Service </h4>
        Upon checking in for the first time, we will ask for the following personal information (NOTE: We value your privacy and will not share this information with anyone):

        <ol>
        <li>Parent/guardian name(s)
        <li>Child's name
        <li>Home address
        <li>Phone number (preferably cell phone number so we can text you during the service if you are needed)
        <li>Any special instructions (allergies, special needs) for your children
        </ol>


        <h4>During Service </h4>
        As you are check in, you will notice that there is a window that allows you to peek in on your child throughout the service.
        In the event that we need to contact you during the service, we will send you a text or quietly come and get you from the service.

        <br><br>
        <h4>End of Service </h4>
        As the service is ending, our volunteers will bring your children to you as we finish out our service in a time of family worship.


        While Bayfront Village Church offers childcare in a learning environment during service, we also understand that not all parents will want to utilize this for their kids. Kids are more than welcome to stay with you during service. If your child is unable to remain in the service the entire time, there is a small foyer space available for you to allow your child to quietly roam and play while you are still able to hear the service.
