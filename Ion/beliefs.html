        <h2 style="text-align:center">Overview of Beliefs</h2>


        <h2>The Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
            We believe the sixty-six books of the Old and New Testaments to be the full record of God’s self-disclosure
            to mankind. Different men, while writing according to their own styles and personalities, were
            supernaturally moved along by the Holy Spirit to record God’s very words, inerrant in the original writings.
            Therefore, those applying themselves to study its literal, historical-grammatical context can accurately
            understand God’s Word. Scripture is fully trustworthy as our final and sufficient authority for all of life
            (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
        </p>


        <h2>The Triune God</h2>
        <p>
            We believe in the one living and true God, eternally (John 17:3) existing in perfect unity as three equally
            and fully divine Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19-20). Each member of the
            Godhead, while executing distinct but complementary roles in redemptive history, has precisely the same
            nature, attributes, and being, and is equally worthy of the same glory and honor and obedience (John 1:1-4;
            Acts 5:3-4).
        </p>

        <h2>Mankind</h2>
        <p>We believe that God created mankind—male and female—in His own image and likeness, free of sin, to glorify
            Himself and enjoy His fellowship. Tempted by Satan, but in the sovereign plan of God, man freely chose to
            disobey God, bringing sin, death and condemnation to all mankind. All human beings, therefore, are totally
            depraved by nature and by choice. Alienated from God without defense or excuse, and subject to God’s
            righteous wrath, all of mankind is in desperate need of the Savior (Genesis 3:1-6; Romans 3:10-19; Romans
            1:18, 32).
        </p>


        <h2>Salvation</h2>
        <p>We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, as the substitutionary
            atonement in our place, and that salvation is found in none other than Jesus Christ. Before Creation, God
            chose those who would be saved and granted this unearned grace solely based on His sovereign good pleasure.
            Jesus Christ’s death on the cross was the sole and complete payment for sins, fully satisfying God’s
            righteous wrath, for each person that turns from sin in repentance and places their faith in Christ alone by
            grace alone. At salvation each person is made a new creation by the Holy Spirit, declared righteous before
            God, and secured as an adopted child of God forever. Genuine faith continues in obedience and love for Jesus
            Christ with a life eager to glorify God and persevere to the end (Romans 8:37-39; 2 Corinthians 5:21; 1
            Corinthians 12:13).
        </p>


        <h2>The Church</h2>
        <p>We believe that upon placing one’s faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior, the believer is made part of the
            Body of Christ, the one universal Church, of which Jesus Christ is the Head. The Scriptures command
            believers to gather locally in order to devote themselves to worship, prayer, teaching of the Word,
            fellowship, the ordinances of baptism and communion, service to the local body through the development and
            use of talents and spiritual gifts, and outreach to the world to make disciples (Ephesians 1:22-23; Acts
            2:42-46; 1 Corinthians 14:26; Matthew 28:18-20). Wherever God’s people meet regularly in obedience to this
            command, there is the local expression of the Church under the watchful care of a plurality of elders. A
            church’s partners are to work together in love and unity, intent on the ultimate purpose of glorifying
            Christ (Ephesians 4:16).
        </p>


        <h2>Baptism and Communion</h2>
        <p>We believe that Christian baptism is a public declaration of the believer’s salvation in Christ, identifying
            with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection symbolized by immersion in water. The Lord’s Supper is
            the united commemoration by believers of Christ’s death until He comes and should be preceded by a careful
            self-examination (Acts 2:41; Romans 6:3-6; 1 Corinthians 11:20-29).
        </p>

        <h2>Missions</h2>
        <p>We believe it is the aim, duty, and privilege of every believer and local church fellowship to glorify God by
            responding as active participants in the Great Commission call of Jesus Christ to go and make disciples of
            all nations.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Come</h2>
        <p>We believe in and expectantly await the glorious, visible, personal, premillennial return of the Lord Jesus
            Christ. The blessed hope of His return has vital bearing on the personal life, service, and mission of the
            believer (1 Thessalonians 4:13-18). We believe in the bodily resurrection of both the saved and the lost.
            The lost will be raised to judgment and experience eternal wrath in hell. The saved will be raised to
            eternal joy in the new heaven and new earth in the manifested presence of God (Acts 1:3, 9; Hebrews
            7:25-26).
